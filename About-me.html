								<h3>As you may have noted:</h3>
								<p>
									I am a <a href="Music.html">musical</a> enthusiast, with a passion for the violin.
									Whether practicing alone or performing in an ensemble, I am continually astounded by hearing, encountering, expressing, and shaping time through sound.
									<strong>Although it may seem strange that a physicist should have such an avid interests in music, I hope you'll see why my experiences as a young musician fed into my development as a physicist.</strong>
								</p>
								<h3>Past: Music & Physics in secondary school and college</h3>
								<p>
									I grew up in the city of Spartanburg, in the piedmont of South Carolina.
									The community at the time was still envious that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_US_Manufacturing_Company">BMW</a> had decided to set up shop in the neighboring Greer county because Spartanburg did not exhibit enough cultural development in the form of active and dynamic arts programs.
									As a result, school district 7 started an orchestra music program so that future employers would not make the same criticism of Spartanburg again.
									<!-- (and the city of spartanburg as <a href="http://www.hubcity.org/">whole</a>) -->
								</p>
								<p>
									My interest in playing the violin began when my brother (who is seven year older than me) started playing with the district 7 middle school orchestra.
									My family still remembers waking up to my efforts at plucking out "baa baa black sheep" on my brother's violin.
									When I was old enough to being playing with the Spartanburg school system orchestras, I naturally gravitated to the violin.
									In addition to my interests in the <a href="Music.html">music</a> itself, I was equally interested in trying to figure out how the instrument worked.
									<strong>In an age where most devices came in proprietary black boxes, the violin was the first device I encountered where I could dis-assemble, look inside, and directly encounter all of the component pieces.</strong>
									I was known for deliberately playing the violin <em>wrong</em> just so that I could hear the way that technical differences would change the sound or even produce weird sounds; sounds like munching (where the bow is raked across the bow hairs when placed against the back plate of the violin), screeching (playing the part of the string between the bridge and tail piece), or playing while controlling pitch with the pegs.
									Most of all, I loved going to the violin shops where the makers would should me finer points about the design and construction of the violin, points like the shape of the bass bar or the positioning of the sound post.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I reached high school, I focused my efforts more to studying the physical sciences, although I continued to perform with the Spartanburg high school symphony.
									While taking AP physics and calculus classes, one of my professors recommended that I participate in the summer science research program.
									This program was designed to further student's interest in pursuing the sciences by encouraging them to perform a literature search in a discipline that interested them and then form a relevant question which could be answered by performing an experiment or simulation.
									The two years that I participated, I gravitated to magnetism by first studying the Curie temperature of several magnets and then by measuring the force law between the two magnets.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I went to Wofford College for my undergraduate studies, I exposed myself to a wide array of disciplines.
									These include my experience at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory studying <a href="Research-Mars.html">Martian geology</a>, at the College of William and Mary studying the <a href="Research-Material.html">electronic properties</a> of perovskite cyrstals and YBCO, and at Wofford College where I worked on the <a href="Research-Protein.html">Protein crystalography</a> of FTHFS as well as <a href="Research-Relativity.html">relativistic corrections</a> to klystrons.
									<strong>These experiences as a whole showed me that I like asking fundamental questions about physical problems, and that I have a particular gift for working with apparatuses.</strong>
								</p>
								<h3>Present: Graduate Work in Physics</h3>
								<p>
									I am closing the chapter on my graduate studies.
									After all of my exposure in undergrad, I found a particular joy in studying strange materials.
									I turned my attention to two-dimensional materials, specifically <a href="Research-Surfactant.html">surfactant monolayers</a> which have shown me that the two dimensional world is much stranger than our familiar three-dimensions.
								</p>
								<p>
									My most gratifying experiences in my studies, however, have been the human encounters.
									Whether <a href="Teaching.html">teaching</a> a class of undergraduates introductory physics, <a href="Outreach.html">presenting</a> my research to fellow scientists, or playing <a href="Music.html">music</a> with my brother-in-law, the human element of research is the most astounding, full of hope and awe, creativity and affection.
								</p>
								<!--
								<h3>Future: Aspirations</h3>
								<p>
									With each step I've taken during my education, I have grown, not only in my understanding of the academic arena, but also of the unique set of gifts and skills that I possess.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Ability to direct and teach</li>
									<li>Skills in non-linear dynamics</li>
									<li>Skills in continuum mechanics and field theories</li>
									<li>Skills in building and developing apparatuses</li>
									<li>Where I see myself going</li>
								</ul>
